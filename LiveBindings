Developer Skill Sprint - LiveBindings From Forms to Code
Video link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sGeY_VWBMI

This is an older video from 2015
examples given are C++ multi-device applications
links given to sample code do not exist

NOTES 
=====================
connect data to Display User Interface elements

Custome expressions
define how data interacts with UI elements

components : 
TBindingsList : added automatically to form
C++ multi-device application
use trackbar to move a circle - cannot find Position.X property of circle using Delphi's TShapes - stCircle


links do not exist :
bidirectional list of objects to grid using TAdapterBindSource : http://embt.co/sprint-livebindings
custom expressions binding object lists in code a TListBox : ListCollections : Samples\Object Pascal\Multi-Device Samples\User Interface\ListCollections

=======================

This is a better demo :
Visual Live Bindings for VCL and Beyond
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVpbY4et2ug)

- make non data aware components data-aware
- ProtoType Bind Source
- dynamically create LiveBindings through code
- linking objects properties to controls in VCL

Demo1 : 
Making a TListView data-aware

Demo2 : 
making controls data aware for TObject using TListBindSourceAdapter and TPrototypeBindSource
